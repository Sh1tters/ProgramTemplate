This template requires MongoDB (free online database) to work.

Once you have created a new Cluster, and made a database + collection, you get the connection string and insert into:

MongoDB.java --> line 20
line 21 for your database name
line 22 for your collection name 

and now you can run the program and all will work perfectly!
